                         Over the three years analyzed, fall volumes decreased significantly compared to other seasons, contrary to intuition. This counterintuitive trend suggests complex factors at play beyond simple harvest cycles, such as changing consumer preferences, market dynamics, and supply chain influences that shape avocado consumption patterns.

                <p>The story of avocado prices is one of supply, demand, and seasonal rhythms. Over the years,
                    prices have shown remarkable volatility, influenced by factors ranging from weather conditions

                <p>While seasonal factors play a significant role, avocado consumption also varies notably by region and state.
                    America's appetite for avocados isn't uniform across states. Cultural preferences, population
                    demographics, and proximity to growing regions all play crucial roles in consumption patterns.</p>
                <div class="interesting-fact">
                    <p>Did you know? California, despite being a major producer, is also the largest consumer of
                        avocados in the United States. This reflects both its large population and its deep-rooted
                        avocado culture.</p>
